It is commonly known that prisoners constitute a harsh school of life. One can learn here the knowledge of human nature, its circuits during every difficult period in a person's life. Above all, I had long been a Jew and there also came those condemned for killing a Pole. I was persecuted by the prison administration in a sophisticated manner. They made it difficult for me to receive correspondence, food packages - I was repeatedly sentenced clearly without basis to solitary confinement. They addressed me with these words "he killed a Pole." From prison they took us out to work on the highway near Kielce in shackles weighing 12 kg. On the road we crushed stones. And so time passed in hard labor and constant harassment. My hopes for early release were not fulfilled. At the head of the Ministry of Justice stood at that time the well-known Jew-eater Grabowski, who established an iron prison regime. One should also mention here the person of the prison warden, who was the former Tsarist officer Bobwiłow. It is significant that the aforementioned Bobwiłow had been transferred to retirement, but after the WKN came to power in Poland he was appointed again as a known satrap and tyrant. The outbreak of war was to become my actual salvation. On the 2nd day after the outbreak of war in 1939 at 12 o'clock at night the prisoners were shackled 2 by 2 by hands and feet and prepared for evacuation. I was shackled with a Jewish prisoner named Chaskielewicz. This was a famous case from before the war. Chaskielewicz had shot a soldier named Sujak. After leaving the prison they led us along various highways without food, without water and without the slightest help. The escort was enormous. For about 900 prisoners there were about 500 guards of armed escort. At every attempt to rest they beat us to unconsciousness, and escape under these conditions obviously could not even be considered. When we reached the vicinity of Kowel my companion Chaskielewicz could no longer walk and asked for water. Then the prison guard leader escorting us, even Pokrywka, pulled out a revolver and shot Chaskielewicz straight in the forehead, so that his brain splattered over all of us. I awaited the same for myself
