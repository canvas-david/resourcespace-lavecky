I notice there may be some confusion in your request. You've asked me to translate Polish text, but what you've provided appears to be a description of an image containing Hebrew text and a monetary denomination "50 zł" (50 zloty).

Based on your description, the only clearly legible text element is:

50 zł

This is a Polish currency denomination (50 zloty) and requires no translation as it represents a numerical value and currency abbreviation.

The Hebrew text portions you mention are described as not clear enough for accurate transcription, so I cannot provide a translation of those elements.
