Description of the character of the landscape and the given reality.

The left landscape Kosman has rich qualities. For its taste, one must distinguish between 2 periods in life. The first period - until World War II. During this period, the landscape participated actively in the war against national persecution - antisemitism. And the life testament of Mark - revenge in relation to antisemites and their churches. If one takes into account that generally the form of resistance was passive, based on existential knowledge, then it is proper to emphasize and illuminate with this bravado the activity of Shmuel Kosman. Among a few friends there exists an opinion that his exiled knowledge was truly believed because of this. Without a song to cope with acquaintances. Kosman's measured response testifies to the French because of this. Planted because of this, Kosman was sentenced by the Polish court to 7-10 years imprisonment for his participation in persecution activities - revenge for his attempt to seek justice in his own way, with joy equipped for organized violence. With the outbreak of the war, the depths of the prison opened before him, however it seems to me that it is impossible to determine that - Shmuel Kosman is a person with qualities in the Jews' war for human dignity, correspondingly. Whether you agree with Mark's form of opinion or not. [unclear] Hebrew groups.

The second period is the period of war in the life of good news of the army against the German army. The landscape from our side that they were obligated to this war as the essence of the war against the nationals. The appearance of vital subjects of this glory. It is possible to accept this determination if we take into account his measure from before the war against and his criticism we lived in life. A difficult breakthrough the landscape raised the army as a disabled young man. The instruction for life and brutalities is not easy. Even after the end of the war when the landscape was delivered to Jewish matters and the hat so that they act in it with pride because of this, unique and warm.
