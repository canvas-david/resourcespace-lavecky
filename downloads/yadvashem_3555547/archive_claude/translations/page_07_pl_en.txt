of our activities and attitudes, and that people repeatedly turned to us with requests for help. No one patronized our organization, nor did anyone finance it. Simply our ardent hearts and strong hands could not reconcile themselves with the fact of the unpunished beating of our fellow brothers. We were known throughout the territory of Borysław, Drohobycz, even Sambor and Stryj, that during disturbances we immediately rushed to help, whenever it was possible. Many times we managed to disperse hooligan-antisemitic gangs and this gave us encouragement in our struggle. Of course, it did not go without conflicts with the Polish police. The police repeatedly arrested some members of our group, but after some time we managed to get our comrades out of prison. Here in turn the local Jews helped us. Among others, the well-known merchant of Drohobycz Saul Bergman intervened in such cases and even thanks to his financial support we managed to avoid greater troubles with the authorities. I do not want to dwell too long on the details of our activities. I have more or less characterized what it consisted of. This type of activity we conducted until the middle of 1935, that is until the period of a more serious clash with the nationalists and even more serious consequences.

In this case these consequences concerned above all me, therefore I would like to discuss these incidents in detail.

On March 3, 1935 incidents of beating Jews took place in Borysław. Our group intervened actively and dispersed the gang of criminal attackers. A few days later on March 11, 1935 we were together with colleagues (Izrael Haas, Edward Ebuston, Maks Reinberg and Salomen Wagman) in a night establishment in Borysław. Leaving the establishment at 12 o'clock at night we were attacked by a group of "Sokols" consisting of 6 people. They opened fire on us with pistols. One of our colleagues returned fire with a revolver. As a result of the shooting the deputy commander of the Riflemen's Association in Borysław by the name of Edmund Leszczynski was killed. We scattered to our homes. In the early morning we were arrested and placed at the disposal of the prosecutorial authorities.
