I also had the opportunity to learn about the material situation of people, which I did in relation to many Polish Jews. Some of them are now found in the territory of Israel today, for example Mr. Feldinger residing in Bat-Jam, family Oppenheim from Tel-Aviv and others. After the liberation of the Lwów territories at the turn of 44/45 I was directed to organize a railway hospital in Lwów on Krasiński Street as administrative director. There I also utilized my position and connections to provide assistance to my co-religionists. In one case of intervention I intervened and myself bore the consequences. Namely, one Ruben Mandel (currently in Israel, Givatin) was arrested by the NKWD for trading in currency and gold. He faced 10 years in prison, since in the USSR such cases are treated as political. I intervened in his case and was also arrested by the NKWD under charges of favoritism and complicity. I spent 3 months in prison, nothing was proven against me, but I was completely ruined and robbed of everything I possessed. I was released and while being tried as a free man I was sentenced to 1 year imprisonment with suspension. Despite the lesson I received I did not give up, I managed to get the aforementioned Mandel out of prison, escort him to the border, from where he fled to Poland. Of course, I did not return to work, I managed to leave as a repatriate to Poland. I should add further that after returning to Lwów I went to search for family in Borysław, and from the few remaining Borysław residents who survived I learned that my entire family was murdered by the Germans and buried in a mass grave under [unclear] in Borysław. Also my wife and child. They probably did not manage to evacuate together with me. After arriving in Poland I went to Kraków, where I was accepted for work as a railway traffic inspector with the Military Command... I worked there not even a full year and resigned, since the work did not suit me. I joined work at PKP. I was assigned to the Świr district. [unclear text]
