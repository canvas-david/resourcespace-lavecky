The attack carried out against us was undoubtedly planned in advance and was intended to liquidate all activity, paralyze our group and thereby destroy Jewish life in our region.

The investigation lasted until May 1935. In May 1935 in Poland, the trial of our group began before a jury court in Sambor. The court proceedings lasted 3 days. The authorities did not know exactly from whose hand the fatal bullet came. The investigation did not establish this. The actual perpetrator did not confess. For we had established among ourselves that for the clarification of the situation, what was the point? Besides me, the remaining members of the group had various family ties (wives, children). If punishment was to befall someone, we wanted to direct the matter so that it would fall to a person not burdened with family. Besides this, other considerations came into play. The wealthy Rozyc and Porysławski families, whom I mentioned elsewhere, made intervention efforts with the authorities for our release or at least maximum mitigation of punishment. We learned of all this through indirect channels. Our activity was known, therefore those who defended us also defended themselves. Besides the aforementioned attorney Morgan Saul, others appeared in our defense, speakers such as Maks Stern, Herman Stern and Dienstag. They also secured defenders for us and were supposed to obtain a promise of lenient sentencing. Taking all these considerations into account, I decided to take the guilt upon myself. I counted on such factors as my previous clean record, possible good behavior in prison and amnesty. My calculations proved somewhat too optimistic. I did not take into account what kind of government Poland had at that time and what factors were decisive.

The jury's verdict was harsh. I received 10 years in prison. The appeal court upheld the verdict. I was sent to serve my sentence at Świętokrzyski prison in Kielce province.

My prison experiences constituted a separate chapter requiring separate treatment at present. I would not want to elaborate on this, I will touch on only a few matters.
