as transport manager. In this position I worked for about 3 years before I resigned and took a job in the new steel mill that was being built. There I encountered obstacles of a strongly antisemitic character and finally left to work in a Jewish workshop where under normal conditions I was seeking new and as a result other opportunities for myself, still young, supervising transport work, and when one day I came to work the Jewish woman Viktorie Dicht [unclear] in the garage there was organized a revolt against accepting her, but I emerged from this defensive struggle with my hand [unclear]. Through various channels I received bitter reproaches that I had accepted a Jewish woman for work. Relations were quite difficult. Then I came to Krakow, established a new family, got married - currently I have a wife who is a teacher by profession and two children. In the interim period, i.e. during the years 47/48, I took active part in the communist organization in the territory of Krakow, [unclear] as well as in the life of people across the border. Through this I supported the organization financially by paying contributions for the "Fighting [unclear]." I have written confirmation of this. I wanted to emigrate to Israel earlier at the turn of 48/49, but I received a written refusal. I could not then decide to force the border, fearing the situation with a small child. - Looking at it today, analyzing and seeing the matter of attitudes toward Jews in various periods of wartime, I would like to state that in the front-line army I generally did not observe manifestations of antisemitism. However, in the rear areas there were clear signs of it, especially in view of the phenomenon of large concentrations of evacuated Jews in cities of the distant rear. Quite characteristic was postwar antisemitism in Soviet territories. It had a seemingly top-down, semi-official character. What came into play here were primarily difficulties in obtaining employment, especially in more prominent positions. These were the beginnings of the nationality regulation policy continued later. This does not mean that antisemitism was only the work of the ruling factors. It found fertile ground below among the most diverse nationalist elements.-
