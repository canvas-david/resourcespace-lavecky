During my stay in Krakow I became better acquainted with the director of "Dom Książki" [House of Books] Mr. Edward Szymczyk. Szymczyk knew about my experiences and often said that they were worthy of literary treatment. On one occasion he introduced me to the Krakow writer Adam Polowka. Polowka became interested in my experiences, especially from the prison period, and was of the opinion that they were worthy of treatment. He therefore proposed to me that we meet for the purpose of my possibly relating my experiences to him. I agreed to this proposal, and I went to Polowka several times in [unclear], where he took detailed notes from my stories. These meetings, however, took place with long interruptions and were not systematic, so that they did not cover the entirety of my experiences. They covered fragments. These detailed notes of Polowka's are in my possession, only I do not know at this moment the exact place of their storage. For I am currently living in temporary housing and I have most of my things packed. The actual book by Polowka was created at the conclusion of these meetings with my accounts.-

Returning to my actual testimony - I want to mention that I worked as transport supervisor in Nowa Huta until the period of departure, which occurred in 1958. Obtaining permission to leave itself also did not come easily to me. Already at that time cases were considered individually and difficulties were created in particular instances. When I obtained permission, first my wife and children departed, and then after a 3-month stay by my wife and children in the country - I left Poland and in 1958 settled in Israel.-

I have given the above testimony of my own free will and I confirm the accuracy of the stated facts with truth by my own signature:
