We remained under interrogation until mid-May 1935. In mid-May the trial of our group opened in the court in Tambov.

The trial lasted 3 days. The authorities did not know exactly who fired the bullet that killed. 

In this interrogation it was not clarified. The guilty man was not found. Thus they determined among us, until the accusation was returned. What was the matter, since they had to clarify in a group of family connections (wife, children). The person had to meet with someone approved, and it was preferable to direct matters so that he would meet with his portion on someone who does not have a family. In addition to this, other considerations also came into account. Jews in particular, whom they chose to save, who had means and connections with the authorities in order to free us, or at least to lighten our punishment. All these became known to us indirectly. Our activity was known and therefore those who stood over them, also endangered their lives. Also - at the time Saul was recommended for our defense, others in the place where the killing occurred. Also the one who killed - [unclear]. They also provided us with a defense lawyer and according to the partnership others to receive reduction regarding the lightening of the punishment. They took into account all these factors and I decided to take the guilt upon myself. I thought in various ways, that I would not remain punished for nothing, I confessed the cause within the prison and the faithful ones. My considerations were too optimistic. I did not take into account how the government was then in Poland and what were the prevailing conditions.

The verdict of the judges was harsh. I received 10 years of prison. Immediately after the sentencing, I was sent to serve the punishment in SWIETOKRZYSKIE prison near Kielce.

Experiences in prison are a separate chapter, requiring separate treatment. I do not wish to elaborate. I wish only to mention several details.

It is known to all, that prison is a house of severe suffering in life. Not everyone can also withstand the conditions of prison. I, personally, went through a very difficult period in prison in a harsh manner. First of all I was revealed to be alone and sentenced for the killing of a Pole. I was persecuted by the prison administration in a harsh manner. They kept watch over me and prevented me from receiving food, demands [unclear] - and not infrequently they imposed punishments on me in solitary confinement. They would say to me in those days: "You are the one who killed a Pole." From the prison they led us to work in chains KELCE - SLUPIE in shackles weighing 12 kg. In heavy chains and they carried drainage ditches. And so in hard labor, malnutrition and harsh slave persecution. The hope to be released early arose in strength. At the head of the administration then stood the [unclear] - "Israel known by the name GRABOWSKI", who succeeded in conducting himself well in prison. It should be mentioned here the role of the prison warden who was a former officer
