I wish to complete quite a bit, that I remained within the chaos of the turmoil in NOWA HUTA until the time of my departure - it seems to me, that is to say in the year 1958.

Even obtaining a permit for my departure did not come easily to me. Already at that time they spoke about matters in an ideological manner and placed obstacles in total cases. When they destroyed the synagogue, I first sent my wife and children and only afterwards, after 3 months had passed, when my wife was already in Israel, I left Poland and in the year 1958 I arrived in Israel.
