In his bosom a harsh economic boycott operation was kindled and proceeding, a siege on Jewish businesses.

The Nazi elements felt themselves strengthened, as they felt the quiet support of the ruling factors. Hence, the harassment of Jews stood at that time beyond any doubt. Therefore, through great effort the youth groups of the movement were organized, which were mentioned above, and began actively to respond to the persecutions. Thus, when it came to our knowledge that in some place they were imposing restrictions on Jews or Jewish businesses or simply discriminating against Jews, we opened retaliatory operations. We had a group of young people, healthy and professional, and we were prepared to provide help to the suffering. The Jews in Breslau, in Dortmund, in other places knew about our activity and our position and therefore they also turned to us more than once and requested help. No one left his signature to our organization and no one assisted it openly. The warm connections and organizational ties could not complete their preparatory work with us without boldness. We were known in the city of Breslau, in Dortmund and even in Sambor - a sign that in times of trouble we immediately rushed to help, if this was only possible. More than once we succeeded in breaking through difficult situations - people helped us in our struggle. As naturally, we often clashed with the police, more than once the police arrested members from our group, but after some time we succeeded in freeing our members from prison. In this the local Jews helped us. Among others, naturally known from Dortmund, who lived in Romania, engaged in such resources and through his intervention we succeeded in reaching major understandings with the authorities. I do not want to elaborate in detail about our activity. Only the general outlines of what was the main effort. The secret of this activity continued until the middle of 1935, and its character up to the period of serious confrontation with the Nazis and to terrible tragic results. In this case the results affected me and therefore I wish to describe in greater detail the events.

On 03.03.1935 there occurred an incident of Jewish harassment in Breslau. After several days we responded actively as usual by distributing red leaflets. After several days, on 11.03.1935, we were four members (Israel Haim, Tzedokah Shonim, Campo Heinumer and I - Shlachti Namin) on a night patrol in Breslau. When we left our meeting place in the night streets, we were attacked by a "Storm Troopers" group consisting of 6 men. They opened fire against us with pistols. The shooting battle took place near the STRZELECK organ in Breslau. When I aimed at the attackers, I scattered to the buildings. At dawn we gathered and came to see the results of the battle. The assault on us was carried out by an organized squad with the purpose of eliminating or destroying our group and thus also increasing the Nazi influence in our area.
