Characterization of the witness and presentation of testimony

Witness Samuel Kostman has a rich past behind him.
In the period "properly one should" various periods in his life-
the first period until the outbreak of the Second World War" in this
period the witness takes active part in the struggle against
nationalist-antisemitic persecutions. This is a form
of retaliatory action against antisemites and their fighting squads. Con-
sidering that more common on the part of Jews was a form of pas-
sive resistance-based on legal foundations-all the more worthy
of emphasis and discussion appears in this light the activity
of Samuel Kostman. In certain Jewish circles there currently
prevails the conviction that diaspora Jewry constituted entirely
a cowardly mass incapable of an act of determined resistance. Kostman's attitude constitutes an example quite the opposite. As evidence of everything Kostman is sentenced by a Polish court to a punishment of 10 years
of prison precisely for participation in retaliatory action, for attempting to seek justice by his own means, when legal forms
fail. The outbreak of war opens the prison gates before him. It seems
however, that one can risk asserting that Samuel Kostman
is a man who has rendered service to the struggle of Jews for their own dignity,
for human dignity-regardless of whether one approves these
forms of struggle or not. Here the objective meaning of facts decides-
The second period is the period of fighting at the front in the ranks of the Soviet army against Hitler's forces. The witness emphasizes in his
testimony that he treated this struggle as a continuation of the fight against nationalism, this time against its most bestial carriers.
One can accept this assertion especially since both his prewar
attitude as well as his mature age and life experience.-
Severely wounded the witness leaves the army ranks as an invalid.
Return to normal life is not easy. Even after the end
of the war the witness tries wherever possible to help the Jewish cause, proving that there beats in him truly a decent Jewish heart.
