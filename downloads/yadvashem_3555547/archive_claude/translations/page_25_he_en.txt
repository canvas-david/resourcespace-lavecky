I was born in Breitlav in 1908. My father worked for 35 years in petroleum sales for the "FANTO" firm. He was a semi-religious man, or more precisely - traditional. Indeed, in our family we observed the traditions of the Jewish community, but we were not orthodox. I was the eldest in the family and when father was called to military service, I began to work for my livelihood and for the family's support. I was part of a Jewish youth group, which already at that time engaged in activities to strengthen the body. By nature I was energetic and active and therefore I quickly rose to the rank of group leader. My friends were: Israel Ham (today in Israel), Adam Hai (today in Israel), Eliot Rushalaim (today in Poland), Feivel Linburg - and Lech Leibu (perished). Through the effort of our youth group became leading in our generation of youth and we excelled in activities, exercises for combat and physical training. The coming life proved that those characteristics became outstanding and they influenced our activities. In the first years after the First World War, antisemitic movements had not yet been felt in Breitlav significantly. In the years 1925/26 anti-Jewish movements began already, but only in the thirties, and especially after Hitler's victory did they intensify. The Jews of Breitlav were generally solidly organized and the majority were laborers. Most Jewish workers worked in petroleum workers in large [companies], various and many. In addition to this there were many craftsmen, merchants, transportation workers and more. Quite large was the stratum of traders. When the aforementioned antisemitic movement began, and although it was solidly [organized], it limited itself to what happened: organizations in unions. They generally sought decent ways to appeal to the administrative and commercial authorities. Influences and mediation came from Polish shops, in order to stop the antisemitic activity, naturally with joint interests.

As far as I remember, until the death of PILSUDSKI in 1935, we received considerable support from many settlements. I remember that after Pilsudski's death, many Jews in Breitlav wept bitterly, since they connected their situation, the stability of the community with Pilsudski's protection. The emergence of the "National Unity Movement," as the official name of the antisemitic enterprise, largely aroused the national elements of Breitlav. In those cases there were also "STRZELEC," the SOKOLOW organization and so forth. To these were also added hooligans and underworld people. More and more cases began of beating Jews during synagogue services, harassment by these elements.
