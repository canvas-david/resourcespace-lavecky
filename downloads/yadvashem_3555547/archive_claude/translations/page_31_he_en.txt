to claim at the bar before that, in the years 1948/49, but my approach troubled me already.

Due to the harassment at the bar I could not then envision, despite the fact that I was truly a family man with a small child.

As mentioned above, I experienced various aspects of Jewish life in different camps during the war, but I determined that in Terebva, in my life I generally did not see antisemitic manifestations. But later there were clear manifestations, especially given the phenomenon of many Jews evacuated in the waters. A typical situation was the antisemitism after the war in Soviet territories. This antisemitism had a semi-warlike, semi-official character. These were harassments in acceptance to work, especially to important enterprises. These were the beginnings of the policy that followed of national sentiment. This does not mean that antisemitism was only the action of Bolshevik elements. It encountered fertile ground among various nationalistic elements.

During my stay in Wrocław I became closely acquainted with the chairman of "Hibbat LeTzafon" Mr. EDWARD SZYMCZUCH. This man knew about my past life and said more than once that he sees the need for processing my literature. On a convenient occasion he introduced me to a Kraków writer named ADAM POLEWKA. This one was interested in my abilities, especially from the hiding period and he too was of the opinion that it was worth processing. He suggested that we meet, with the intention of recommending to write down my abilities and experiences. I agreed to our meeting and came not once to Mr. Polewka in Wrocław, where he would write down by hand details from my life story. However these meetings took place with large interruptions and not in a regular manner, so that they did not encompass the full scope of my experiences, but only fragments. These manuscripts of Polewka disappeared somewhere, and regarding this I do not remember the place of their disappearance. And if they still remain somewhere in hiding, that is to say in France and perhaps the things are still lost. In truth the matter of Polewka came to an end and did not enable completing the recording of my memories.
