time. In Borysław I got married and after 2 months had passed I moved my family to Lwów where we resided. After some time the commander of my unit was transferred for service to the headquarters of the 12th Army in Stanisławów, where I also went along with him. In Stanisławów I served as transport manager in a military unit until the outbreak of the German-Soviet war in 1941. On the day the war broke out I was assigned along with my superior to the Stryj airfield. Our task was to destroy divisional units, stations, etc., that is to ensure their delivery to the airfield. Due to the nature of my functions it followed that I had to stay until the very end. After completing the evacuation activities I was the only one with a vehicle to follow behind the unit. Near Kharkiv I was wounded and transported to a medical sector and placed in Hospital No. 20 in Kharkiv. After recovery I was assigned to military unit 2146 and together with it took part in the defense of Moscow. After the conclusion of operations near Moscow we were transferred by vehicles to the Stalingrad region. During military operations in the vicinity of Stalingrad I was wounded in the abdomen and additionally fell into encirclement. I managed together with my comrades to break out of the encirclement and get through to our own forces. As severely wounded I was evacuated to the deep rear. Specifically I was transported to a military hospital in Borisznikt in the Urals (Molotov Oblast). I lay in the hospital for about 5 months. Due to complications my spleen was surgically removed. I was discharged from the hospital as a war invalid in 1943. I went to Dzhambul in the Kazakh SSR. I obtained employment there as technical director of large garages for motor transport, delivering food for the army. I received this position as a specialist and war invalid. I used my position as much as possible to provide assistance to Jews also residing there. I hired many for work in the facilities under my management. Here I can provide an example: Jazkow Morgenstern from Hercołja [unclear] Nof-Jam.
