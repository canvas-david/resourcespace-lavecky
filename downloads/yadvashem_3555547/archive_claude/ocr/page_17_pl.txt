Looking at this archival document image, I can extract the following text:

50 zł

[Note: The image appears to be a stamp or postal marking with Hebrew text at the top and bottom. The Hebrew text is visible but given the image quality and my instructions to focus on what's clearly legible, I can definitively make out the "50 zł" denomination marking. The Hebrew text portions are present but not clear enough for accurate character-by-character transcription in this image quality.]
