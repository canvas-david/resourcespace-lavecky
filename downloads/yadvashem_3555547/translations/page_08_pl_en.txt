The assault carried out against us was undoubtedly orchestrated from above and was intended to liquidate or paralyze our group, and thereby the Jewish self-defense in our district.-

We remained in detention during the investigation until mid-May 1935. In mid-May, the trial of our group began before the jury court in Sambor. The court proceedings lasted 3 days. The authorities did not know exactly from whose hand the fatal bullet had come. The investigation did not establish this. The actual perpetrator did not confess. For this is what we had agreed among ourselves, until the situation became clear. What was at stake? Apart from me, the other members of the group had various family ties /wives, children/. If punishment was to befall someone, we wanted to direct matters so that it would fall to a person not burdened with a family. Besides this, other factors also came into play. The wealthy Jews of Borysław, whom I mentioned elsewhere, made interventional efforts with the authorities for our release or at least the maximum mitigation of the sentence. We learned about all this through indirect channels. Our activities were known, therefore those who defended us were also defending themselves. Apart from Saul Borgman, whom I mentioned, merchants and industrialists such as Maks Stern, Herman Stern, and Dienstag appeared in our defense. They also provided us with defense attorneys and reportedly obtained a promise of a lenient sentence. Taking all these factors into consideration, I decided to take the guilt upon myself. I counted on such factors as my previous clean record, possible good behavior in prison, and amnesty. My calculations proved somewhat too optimistic. I did not take into account what kind of government Poland had at the time and what factors were decisive.

The verdict of the jury court was severe. I received 10 years in prison. The cassation appeal upheld the verdict. I was transferred to serve my sentence at Świętokrzyski prison in the Kielce voivodeship.-

My prison experiences constitute a separate chapter requiring entirely separate treatment. I would not wish to dwell on them, I will only touch upon a few matters.-
