I wish to complete and say that I worked as transport manager at NOWA HUTA until the time of my departure - my journey, that is to say in 1958. Obtaining a permit for my journey did not come easily to me either. Already at that time they handled matters on an individual basis and created difficulties in certain cases. When I obtained the permit, I first sent my wife and children, and only afterwards, after 3 months, when my wife was already in Israel, I left Poland and in 1958 I arrived in Israel.
