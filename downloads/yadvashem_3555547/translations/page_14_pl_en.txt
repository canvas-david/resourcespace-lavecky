During my stay in Kraków, I became better acquainted with the director of "Dom Książki" [House of Books], Mr. Edward Szymczuch. Szymczuch knew about my experiences and often said that they were worthy of literary treatment. On one occasion he introduced me to the Kraków writer Adam Polewka. Polewka became interested in my experiences, especially the prison period, and was also of the opinion that they were worthy of treatment. He therefore proposed that we meet for the purpose of my possibly relating my experiences. I agreed to this proposal, and went to Polewka's several times in the evenings, during which he made handwritten notes of my accounts. However, these meetings took place with long intervals and not systematically, so that they did not cover the entirety of my experiences, but only a fragment. These handwritten notes of Polewka's are in my possession, only I do not know at this moment the exact location where they are packed. For the time being I am living in temporary accommodation, i.e. [unclear: crifie], and most of my things are packed. Actually, Polewka's death prevented the completion of recording my accounts.

Returning to my actual account—I wish to add that I worked as transport manager in Nowa Huta until the period of departure, which occurred in 1958. Obtaining permission to leave was also not easy for me. Already at that time cases were considered individually and difficulties were made in particular instances. When I obtained permission, I first sent my wife and children, and then after my wife's 3-month stay with the children in the country—I left Poland and in 1958 I found myself in Israel.
