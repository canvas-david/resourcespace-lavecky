to travel already earlier, in the years 1948/49, but I received a refusal in writing. I could no longer decide on crossing borders illegally at that time, when on my shoulders lay the responsibility for a family with a small child.

As I analyze today and see the matter of the attitude toward Jews in different periods during the war, I determine that in the army, at the front, I generally did not see antisemitic phenomena. But in the rear there were clear phenomena, especially in view of the phenomenon of concentration of evacuated Jews in cities. Very characteristic was the antisemitism after the war in the Soviet territories. This antisemitism had a character as if from above, semi-official. These were restrictions in acceptance for employment, especially for important positions. These were the beginnings of the later policy of national regulation. This does not mean that antisemitism was only the doing of government authorities. It encountered fertile ground among various nationalist elements.

During my stay in Krakow I became closely acquainted with the director of "The House of the Book" - Mr. EDWARD SZYMCZUCH. This man knew about my experiences in the past and said more than once that they were worthy of literary treatment. On a certain occasion he introduced me to a Krakow writer by the name of ADAM POLEWKA. He was interested in my memories, especially from the prison period, and he too was of the opinion that they were worthy of treatment. He proposed that we meet, with the intention of putting my memories and experiences in writing. I agreed to his proposal and went more than once to Mr. Polewka in the evenings, while he wrote down by hand details from my stories. However, these meetings took place with large gaps and not in a regular manner, so that they did not cover the full scope of my experiences, but only fragments. These notes by Polewka are in my possession, but at this moment I do not remember their location. Since I am still residing in temporary housing, that is to say in a shack, and most of the things are still packed. In truth, Polewka's death put an end to it and did not allow the recording of my memories to be completed.
