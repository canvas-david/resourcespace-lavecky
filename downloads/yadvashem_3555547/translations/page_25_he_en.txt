**Content of the Testimony.**

---

I was born in Boryslaw in 1908. My father was a clerk for 35 years at an oil mine belonging to the firm "FANTO". He was a half-believer, more accurately - traditional. Hence, in our family we observed the customs of Jewish tradition, but we were not devout. I was the eldest in the family and when father was called up for army service, I began working to support myself and the family.

I was part of a Jewish youth group, which already at that time engaged in sports, in order to strengthen the body. By nature I was energetic and active, and therefore I quickly rose to the position of group leader. My friends were: Israel Haas (currently in Israel), Adas Hai (today in Israel), Eliash Rishles (currently in Poland), Philip Libsen and Herman Leiner (perished). Over time, our youth group became the leader of our generation and excelled in its activity, combat readiness, and sports achievements. The days that followed proved that those characteristics became necessary and influenced our activities. In the first years after World War I, we did not yet feel an organized antisemitic movement in Boryslaw. In the years 1925/26 anti-Jewish movements already began, and only in the thirties, and especially after Hitler's victory, did they intensify. The Jews of Boryslaw were a solidary and well-organized community. This was influenced by the fact that most Jews worked in large oil enterprises, wax factories, etc. In addition, there were many craftsmen, porters, transport workers, and more. The merchant class was fairly large.

When the organized antisemitic movement began, the stance of all these was solidary, but limited itself to what is called: passive resistance. They generally sought legal protection from the administrative authorities and the police. They utilized influences and connections with Polish circles in order to halt antisemitic activity, of course with varying success.

As far as I remember, until the death of PILSUDSKI in 1935, these connections often yielded many achievements. I remember that after PILSUDSKI's death, many Jews in Boryslaw actually wept, because they tied their fate, the stability of the situation, to Pilsudski's personality. The creation of the "Camp of National Unity," as if an official control of the antisemitic enterprise, greatly revived nationalist elements of Boryslaw. At the head of this action were men of "STRZELEC", the SOKOLOW organization, etc. Hooligans and underworld elements also joined them. Cases of Jews being beaten by gangs composed of these elements began more and more frequently.
