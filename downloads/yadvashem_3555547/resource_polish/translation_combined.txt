Characterization of the witness and summary of testimony
1212 700-P
03/1619
The witness Samuel Kostman has rich experiences behind him.
One should actually distinguish separate periods in his life.-
The first period until the outbreak of the Second World War. In this
period the witness takes an active part in the struggle against
nationalist-antisemitic persecution. This is a form of
retaliatory action against antisemites and their militant groups. Con-
sidering that a more common form among Jews was that of pas-
sive resistance-based on legal grounds-the activity of
Samuel Kostman appears all the more worthy of emphasis
and discussion in this light. In some Jewish circles there prevails
a current belief that diaspora Jewry constituted entirely
a cowardly mass incapable of an act of determined resistance. Kost-
man's attitude represents a directly opposite example. On top of every-
thing, Kostman is sentenced by a Polish court to 10 years
in prison precisely for participation in retaliatory action, for attempting to seek
justice by his own means, when legal forms
fail. The outbreak of war opens the prison gates before him. It seems,
however, that one can risk asserting that Samuel Kostman
is a man of merit in the Jewish struggle for their own dignity,
for human dignity-regardless of whether one approves of these
forms of struggle or not. Here the objective meaning of the facts decides.-
The second period is the period of combat at the front in the ranks of the Soviet
army against the Hitlerite forces. The witness emphasizes in his
testimony that he treated this struggle as a continuation of the fight against nation-
alism, this time against its most bestial carriers.
One can accept this assertion considering both his prewar
attitude as well as his mature age and life experience.-
Severely wounded, the witness leaves the military ranks as an invalid.
Return to normal life is not easy. Even after the end
of the war, the witness endeavors wherever he can to help the Jewish
cause, proving that a truly warm, Jewish heart beats within him.

Text of testimony
I was born in Borysław in 1908. My father was for a period
of 35 years a clerk at an oil mine belonging to the "Fanto" company.
He was a man half-believing, rather traditional. Hence in
our family we observed the customs of Jewish tradition
without however being devout. I was the eldest in the family and
when father was called up for military service I began gainful work
to support the family. I was in a group of Jewish youth
which already at that time engaged in sports in order to develop
physical fitness and resilience. By nature I was energetic and
active, therefore I quickly rose to the forefront of this group.
My colleagues were: Izrael Haas /currently in Israel/, Adas Haj
/also residing in Israel/, Eliasz Riszeles /currently in Poland/,
Filip Liebesman and Herman Leiner /deceased/. With the passage of time
our youth group rose to the forefront of the young generation
of that time in terms of combativeness, activity and athletic
fitness. The coming period showed how precisely these qualities became
necessary and what role they played in our activities. In the first
years after World War I we did not yet feel in
Borysław any organized anti-Semitic action. In the years
1925/6 anti-Jewish movements already began, however only
in the thirties, especially after Hitler's victory, did they gain
--- Page 06 ---

in strength and determination. The Jewry of Borysław was generally a solidary and organized community. This was influenced by the fact that most Jews worked in large petroleum enterprises, ozokerite works, and similar. Moreover, there were many craftsmen, porters, transport workers, and others. The merchant class was also quite numerous. When the organized antisemitic movement began, the stance of these many groups was generally solidary, though it was limited to so-called passive resistance. Protection was sought primarily through legal means from administrative and police authorities. Influence in various Polish circles was used to curb anti-Jewish actions, of course with varying success. As far as I can recall, until Piłsudski's death in 1935, such interventions often achieved immediate successes. I remember that after Piłsudski's death, many Jews in Borysław wept sincerely. For they tied their fate, the stability of their situation, to the person of Piłsudski. The creation of the Camp of National Unity, and thus the quasi-official patronage of antisemitic action, considerably invigorated the nationalist elements of Borysław. At the head of this action stood people from the "Strzelec" organization, Sokół organizations, and the like. Various riffraff and hooligans naturally joined them as well. Incidents of Jews being beaten by gangs composed precisely of the aforementioned elements began to occur with increasing frequency. An economic boycott action began on a large scale, with picketing of Jewish shops. Nationalist elements felt more firmly in the saddle, sensing the tacit support of the ruling factors. Hence the previous forms of Jewish defense were becoming insufficient. That is why, partly on my initiative at that time, the group of our youth which I have already mentioned began to react more actively to the persecutions. Namely, if word reached us that Jewish shops were to be picketed at such and such a place, or that Jews were simply being attacked—we would launch a retaliatory action. There were a dozen or so of us, young, healthy, and athletic people, but above all determined to provide help to those being attacked. The Jewry of Borysław, Drohobycz, and other smaller localities knew
--- Page 07 ---
141
our activities and stance, hence we were frequently approached
with requests for help. No one patronized our organization,
nor did anyone finance it. Simply our ardent hearts
and strong fists could not reconcile themselves with the fact of unpunished beating
of our brethren. We were known throughout Borysław, Droho-
bycz, even Sambor and Stryj, that during disturbances we would immediately
rush to help, if only it was possible. On numerous occasions
we managed to disperse hooligan-antisemitic gangs and this
gave us courage in our struggle. Of course, there were
conflicts with the Polish police. On more than one occasion the police arrested
some members of our group, but after some time we managed
to get our comrades out of prison. Here in
turn local Jews helped us. Among others, the well-known merchant
of Drohobycz Saul Borgman intervened in such cases and even
thanks to his financial support we managed to avoid larger
conflicts with the authorities. I do not wish to elaborate too long on the details
of our activities. I have more or less characterized what
it consisted of. This very kind of activity we carried
out until mid-1935, that is, until the period of a more serious clash
with the nationalists and even more serious consequences.—
In this case, these consequences concerned above all me,
therefore I would like to discuss these events in more detail.—
On March 3, 1935, incidents of beating Jews took place in Borysław.
Our group actively intervened and dispersed a gang of Endek
assailants. A few days later, on March 11, 1935, we were together
with colleagues /Izrael Haas, Edward Szust, Maks Heinberg
and Salomon Wagman/ at a nightclub in Borysław. Leaving the
establishment at 12 o'clock at night we were attacked by a group
of "Sokół" members consisting of 6 persons. They opened fire at us with pistols.
One of our colleagues returned fire with a revolver. As a re-
sult of the shooting, the deputy commander of the Riflemen's Association
in Borysław by the name of Edmund Leszczyński was killed.—
We scattered to our homes. At dawn we were arrested
and placed at the disposal of the prosecutorial authorities.—
--- Page 08 ---

The assault carried out against us was undoubtedly orchestrated from above and was intended to liquidate or paralyze our group, and thereby the Jewish self-defense in our district.-

We remained in detention during the investigation until mid-May 1935. In mid-May, the trial of our group began before the jury court in Sambor. The court proceedings lasted 3 days. The authorities did not know exactly from whose hand the fatal bullet had come. The investigation did not establish this. The actual perpetrator did not confess. For this is what we had agreed among ourselves, until the situation became clear. What was at stake? Apart from me, the other members of the group had various family ties /wives, children/. If punishment was to befall someone, we wanted to direct matters so that it would fall to a person not burdened with a family. Besides this, other factors also came into play. The wealthy Jews of Borysław, whom I mentioned elsewhere, made interventional efforts with the authorities for our release or at least the maximum mitigation of the sentence. We learned about all this through indirect channels. Our activities were known, therefore those who defended us were also defending themselves. Apart from Saul Borgman, whom I mentioned, merchants and industrialists such as Maks Stern, Herman Stern, and Dienstag appeared in our defense. They also provided us with defense attorneys and reportedly obtained a promise of a lenient sentence. Taking all these factors into consideration, I decided to take the guilt upon myself. I counted on such factors as my previous clean record, possible good behavior in prison, and amnesty. My calculations proved somewhat too optimistic. I did not take into account what kind of government Poland had at the time and what factors were decisive.

The verdict of the jury court was severe. I received 10 years in prison. The cassation appeal upheld the verdict. I was transferred to serve my sentence at Świętokrzyski prison in the Kielce voivodeship.-

My prison experiences constitute a separate chapter requiring entirely separate treatment. I would not wish to dwell on them, I will only touch upon a few matters.-
--- Page 09 ---

It is commonly known that prison is a hard school of life. Not everyone endures prison conditions. I personally lived through a difficult period in prison. First and foremost because I was a Jew and on top of that convicted of killing a Pole. I was persecuted by the prison administration in a refined manner. They made it difficult for me to receive correspondence, food parcels - I was repeatedly sentenced to solitary confinement on completely groundless charges. They addressed me with these words: "Jew, you killed a Pole." We were led out of the prison to work on the Słupia-Kielce road in shackles weighing 12 kg. On the road we broke stones. And so time passed in hard labor and incessant harassment. My hopes for early release did not come true. At the head of the Ministry of Justice at that time stood the well-known Jew-hater Grabowski, who introduced an iron prison regime. One should also mention here the person of the prison warden, who was a former Tsarist officer Botwiłow. It is telling that the aforementioned Botwiłow had been retired, but after the OZN came to power in Poland he was called back as a known satrap and tyrant. The outbreak of war was to become my actual salvation. On the 2nd day after the outbreak of war in 1939, at 12 o'clock at night, the prisoners were shackled in pairs by hands and feet and prepared for evacuation. I was shackled with a Jewish prisoner named Chaskielewicz. It was a famous case before the war. Chaskielewicz had shot and killed a non-commissioned officer Sgt. Bujak in the army. After leaving the prison we were led along various roads without food, without water and without the slightest assistance. The escort was enormous. For approximately 900 prisoners there were about 500 armed escort guards. At every attempt to rest, they beat us unconscious; escape under these conditions of course was out of the question. When we reached the vicinity of Kowel, my companion Chaskielewicz could no longer walk and asked for water. Then the prison guard corporal escorting us, named Pokrywka, drew his revolver and shot Chaskielewicz straight in the forehead, so that his brain splattered over all of us. I expected the same for myself
--- Page 10 ---

fate. Since they did not want to unshackle us, I had to carry the corpse
on my back for 4 km. Only along the way, at some prison during a rest
stop, was I unshackled and shackled again to another prisoner, one
Jan Zawadzki. We were driven back in the direction of
Krasnystaw. In Krasnystaw we stopped at the local prison. The prison warden took pity on us and ordered soup to be cooked
for us. We were unshackled and placed in cells. At night
at 2 o'clock a bomb hit one of the corners of the prison. The guards,
frightened, left us locked in the cells and fled, taking
our personal belongings onto carts. In the morning - seeing that there was no
prison administration, we began breaking down the doors. The door of my
cell was broken down first. I found tools and opened
all the doors. - We were free, but still locked in the
prison courtyard. We made a human ladder, got ourselves
onto the wall and began calling for help. The local population came
to our aid, broke down the main gate and we were finally
truly free. - Now we split up into small groups and
set off on our way. My travel companion was quite a characteristic
figure. He was a Jew, by profession a so-called mohel. He had been sentenced to 15 years
in prison for the following incident: his daughter had an illegitimate
child with a Pole who had abandoned her. The grandfather wanted to make
his grandson a Jew, so he subjected him to circumcision - after which the child died.
For this crime he received a sentence and just like me, the war freed
him. We headed in the direction of Lwów. Approximately 5-6 km
before Lwów, Soviet soldiers stopped me and took me
to the Commandant's office as a suspicious person without any documents. On my shirt I also had the stamp of the Świętokrzyskie
prison. After lengthy interrogations I was released. By that
time the military campaign in Poland had ended and the Soviet Army
had occupied the territories of Western Ukraine and Belarus. When the Germans withdrew
from Borysław, I went to my home town. I decided
to volunteer for the Soviet Army. I treated this step as
a continuation of my pre-war struggle against nationalism. I was accepted and assigned as a driver to the Chief of the Sanitary
Service of the city of Lwów, Major Chernikhov. With him I traveled for a longer
--- Page 11 ---

time.-In Borysław I got married and after 2 months
I moved my family to Lwów-where we settled. After some
time the commander of my unit was transferred on duty
to the staff of the 12th Army in the town of Stanisławów, where I also went along
with him. In Stanisławów I served as head of transport
in the military unit, until the outbreak of the German-Soviet
war in 1941. On the day the war broke out I was assigned along
with my superior to the Stryj airfield. Our task was
evacuating the civilian population, the wounded, etc., that is to say ensuring
their transport to the airfield. Due to the nature of my duties it
followed that I had to stay until the very end. After completing the evacuation
operations I set out by car following the unit. Near
Charków I was wounded in the leg, loaded onto a hospital train
and placed in a hospital 20 km beyond Charków. After recovery
I was assigned to military unit 2146 and together
with it I take part in the defense of Moscow. After the conclusion of the operation near
Moscow we were transported by cars to the Stalingrad region.
During military operations in the vicinity of Stalingrad I was
wounded in the abdomen and on top of that fell into encirclement. I managed
together with my comrades to break out of the encirclement and get through to
our own forces. As seriously wounded I am evacuated deep to the rear.
Namely I was transported to a military hospital in the town of Berez-
niki in the Urals /Molotov oblast/. In the hospital I lay
for about 5 months. Due to complications my spleen was removed
surgically. From the hospital I was discharged as a
war invalid in 1943. I went to the town of Dzhambul in the Kazakh
SSR. There I obtained employment as technical director
of large motor transport garages, supplying
food for the army. I received this position as a specialist and
a war invalid. I used my position as much as possible
to provide assistance to Jews living there. Many
I hired to work in the establishments under my supervision. Here I can provide
names: Yaakov Morgenstern residing in Herzliya B Nof-Yam.

I also had the opportunity to provide material assistance to people, which I did in relation to many Polish Jews. Some of them are currently in Israel today, for example: Mr. Feldinger residing in Bat-Yam, the Oppenheim family from Tel Aviv, and others. After the liberation of the Lwów territories at the turn of 1944/45, I was assigned to organize a railway hospital in Lwów on Krasickich Street as the administrative director. There too I used my position and connections to provide assistance to my brethren. In one case of intervention, I went too far and suffered the consequences myself. Namely, a certain Mr. Leon Mandel (currently in Israel, Givatayim) was arrested by the NKVD for trading in currency and gold. He faced 10 years in prison, as the Russians treat such matters as political offenses. I intervened on his behalf and was also arrested by the NKVD on charges of aiding or complicity. I spent 3 months in prison, nothing was proven against me, but I was completely ruined and robbed of everything I possessed. I was released and, while answering charges as a free man, I was sentenced to 1 year in prison with suspension. Despite the lesson I received, I did not give up; I still managed to get the aforementioned Mandel out of prison, transport him to the border, from where he fled to Poland. Of course, I did not return to work; I managed to leave as a repatriate to Poland. I wish to add that after returning to Lwów, I went to Borysław to search for my family. From the few Borysław residents who remained alive, I learned that my entire family had been murdered by the Germans and buried in a mass grave near the slaughterhouse in Borysław. Including my wife and child. They had not managed to evacuate together with me. After arriving in Poland, I went to Kraków, where I was accepted for work as a traffic inspector at the Voivodeship Citizens' Militia Headquarters. I worked there for less than a year and resigned, as the work did not suit me. I took up employment at the Kraków Enterprise for Trade in Breeding Animals
--- Page 13 ---

in the capacity of transport supervisor. In this position I worked for approximately 3 years, after which I resigned and took up work in the Nowa Huta construction site. There I encountered manifestations of strong antisemitism. It manifested itself in the treatment of Jewish workers, creating difficulties in hiring new ones, and in various other forms of harassment. I personally continued to be in charge of transport, and when one day I hired a Jewish woman, Wiktoria Dichter /currently in Israel/, a revolt was organized against her hiring, but I emerged from this ordeal unscathed. Through various channels I was bitterly reproached for hiring a Jewish woman for work. Relations were quite difficult. After arriving in Kraków, I started a new family, I got married—I now have a wife who is a teacher by profession, and two children. In the meantime, i.e., at the turn of 1947/48, I took active part in the Zionist organization in the Kraków area, Poalej Sjon/, as well as in sending people across the border. In addition, I provided considerable financial assistance to the organization by contributing appropriate sums to "Fighting Palestine." I have written confirmations of this. I wished to leave for Israel earlier, at the turn of 1948/49, but I received a written refusal. I could no longer decide to force the border, burdened as I was with a family and a small child.—As I analyze and see today the matter of attitudes toward Jews in various periods of wartime, I would like to state that in the frontline army I generally did not observe manifestations of antisemitism. However, in the rear areas there were already clear signs of it, especially in view of the phenomenon of large concentrations of evacuated Jews in far rear cities. Quite characteristic was the postwar antisemitism in Soviet territories. It had, as it were, a top-down, semi-official character. What came into play here were primarily harassment in hiring for work, especially for more prominent positions. These were the beginnings of the nationality regulation policy that was continued later. This does not mean that antisemitism was solely the work of ruling factors. It found fertile ground below, among the most diverse nationalistic elements.—

During my stay in Kraków, I became better acquainted with the director of "Dom Książki" [House of Books], Mr. Edward Szymczuch. Szymczuch knew about my experiences and often said that they were worthy of literary treatment. On one occasion he introduced me to the Kraków writer Adam Polewka. Polewka became interested in my experiences, especially the prison period, and was also of the opinion that they were worthy of treatment. He therefore proposed that we meet for the purpose of my possibly relating my experiences. I agreed to this proposal, and went to Polewka's several times in the evenings, during which he made handwritten notes of my accounts. However, these meetings took place with long intervals and not systematically, so that they did not cover the entirety of my experiences, but only a fragment. These handwritten notes of Polewka's are in my possession, only I do not know at this moment the exact location where they are packed. For the time being I am living in temporary accommodation, i.e. [unclear: crifie], and most of my things are packed. Actually, Polewka's death prevented the completion of recording my accounts.

Returning to my actual account—I wish to add that I worked as transport manager in Nowa Huta until the period of departure, which occurred in 1958. Obtaining permission to leave was also not easy for me. Already at that time cases were considered individually and difficulties were made in particular instances. When I obtained permission, I first sent my wife and children, and then after my wife's 3-month stay with the children in the country—I left Poland and in 1958 I found myself in Israel.
