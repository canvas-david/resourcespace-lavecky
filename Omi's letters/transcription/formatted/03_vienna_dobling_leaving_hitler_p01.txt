My life. I consider myself very happy to have lived a very full + active life. Not every body in this world, is allowed to start 3 times over + be successful. Just than our generation did not have it very easy, but hard steel has to go through hot fire - don't take it allways the easy way out, look out for challenges.

Well here I go + do something I do not want to do "give advise".

Now back to the "beginning". My real life, the one I remember started in 17. Leidesdorf gasse Wien 19" Bezirk Döbling. Thats where I spent my schoolyears, my first love, my hopes + where one part of my life ended, + the place I left when Hitler came + I left my family + all I loved with one suit case, and a very sorrow heart.

You see in spite of coming from what they call today a "broken home" I had the most wonderful youth one can immagine.
