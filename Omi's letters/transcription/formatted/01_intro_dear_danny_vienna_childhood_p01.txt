Dear Danny,

After having tryed several times to write my memories in an unorthodox way - funny - exciting - good I gave up. I will just write facts in chronological order and than if I will still have time I might write a few episodes of my life.

As you know I was born in Vienna during the first world war. When I was one year old the war ended. That war was called the WAR to end all wars little did they know that that is not the human nature. My parents than decided to buy a factory near Vienna (Inzersdorf and yes I should and would have taken you there when we were in Vienna - but helas - I broke my arm).

That my Father was grinding colours from stones like ochre (yellow) red earth etc. My memory from that time relies on stories told to me later, but one thing sticks out of that time, we had white rabbits there and pending what colour was prilled a they where either [...] pink, yellow or grey and mother told me so was 7 - yes I was very fair and my hair took all the coloured dust.

We also had a big shepard dog called Rolfi, why god knows Rolfi was a female, we were all ways together. The house had a huge door to let horsedrawn waggens into the factory and cut into that big door was a smaller one. Now one day Rolfi who by now learned to open the little door, [...] Rolfi learned how to open that little door, and one day I decided to go with Rolfi for a walk.
