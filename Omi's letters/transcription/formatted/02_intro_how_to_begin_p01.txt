Danny, I told you often little episodes of my life, but then you asked me to write a whole life story, a span over two generations. But I am not a writer - how do I begin? All you will say "start at the beginning"! That's easy to say, but where is the beginning?! When I was born, when my parents married? When they got divorced when I was only three years?

You know what; I shall write just as I told you before, little episodes as they come to my mind, and later you can put them into chronical order or just put them into a drawer and take them out when you are old like me and start to live with your memories.

When one is young you collect memories for later, and over the years all memories are getting mellower. The bad ones are getting somehow better & the very exciting ones are also losing a bit of the excitement, but believe me, in spite of many terrible experiences in
