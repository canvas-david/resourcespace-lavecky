Danny I told you often little Episodes of my life but than you asked me to write a whole life story a span over two generation, but I am not a writer how do I begin? All you will say "start at the Beginning"! Thats easy to say but where is the beginning?! When I was born, when my parents married? When they got divorced when I was only three years? you know what; I shall write just as I told you before, little Episodes as they come to my mind and later you can put them into chronical order or just into "drawer and take them out when you are old like me and start to live with your memories. Then one is young you collect "memories" for later and and over the years all memories are getting mellower the bad ones are getting somehow better & the very exciting ones are also also loosing a bit of the excitement but believe me in spite of many terrible experiences in
