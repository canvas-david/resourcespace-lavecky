It was a most memorable time. Coming back to Cairo Vily was in a very bad state of health. We had one room in a "Pension". Luckily the Proprietress did not send Vily to hospital as suggested by a local doctor who thought that he had typhoid. We kept him in bed and in the one room we had. What a room! Facing west south west it was hot really hot we had days and weeks in Cairo with temperature not dropping below 40°C. Our window view was towards an arid mountain called Mokattam which I will never forget in its ugliness. Except in the evening like an english lady who gets dressed for dinner it surrounds itself with the most beautiful colours of sunset from pink to purple until right black with the biggest and brightest stars one can immagine... And in the midst of it the pyramids.
