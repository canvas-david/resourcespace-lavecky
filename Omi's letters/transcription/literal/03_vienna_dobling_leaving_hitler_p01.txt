my life I consider myself very happy +
to have lived a very full + active life.
Not every body in this world, is allowed
to start 3 times over + be successful. Just
than pur generation did not have it very
easy, but hard ~~that~~ steel has to go
through hot fire - don't take it allways
the easy way out, look out for challenges.
Well here I go + do something I do not want
to do "give advise".
Now back to the "beginning".
My real life ~~started~~, the one I remember
started in 17. Leidesdorf gasse Wien
19" Bezirk Döbling. Thats where I spent
my schoolyears, my first love, my hopes
+ ~~my big sorrows the end of our~~
~~family life~~ + where one part of my life
ended, + the place I left when Hitler
came + I left my family + all I loved
with one suit case, and a very sorrow heart.
You see in spite of coming from what they
call today a "broken home" I had the
most wonderful youth one can immagine
