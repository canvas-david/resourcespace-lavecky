A little background from your father - a little bit of your Grandfather Vily.

Vienna where I grow up was poor after the first world war but as many poor people it tried to recompensate with a lifestyle far beyond its means. Theaters were full - operas were at its brightest there was Richard Tauber Selma Kurz great singers and even greater Composers like Franz Lehar Robert Stolz Kalman its no use telling you because you will + can not immagine the gaiety we had and at the same time the poverty the angiety we felt + if we will be able to pay next months rent.
