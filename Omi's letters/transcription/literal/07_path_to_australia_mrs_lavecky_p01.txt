It happened that - How we came to Australia. Wrote before how it developed in Cairo.

Well after we came back from America still undecided what + where to go, again to leave all we have build up. We considered seriously the offer of Signor Emilio to settle in Glacina, country near Florence. We were there in 46 Easter - it is a lovely sleepy village surrounded by olive trees. The people there live mostly of farm products + in their spare time the women produced beautiful hand embroidered lingery. Emilo had a little cottage there + wanted us to live in it + start a factory for underwear + have it supplemented with hand embroidery. Well that was our plan.

Then things started to change in the most unusual way. I had a friend Mrs Goldscheider - our Nanny at that time was her childrens nurse. Her son, she came in the factory and asked me if I could run across the street where her mother in law lived to give her an urgent message. Her telephon was out of order and the lady who stayed with her was due to leave Egypt that same day.

So I went to Mrs Stroh to give her the message. There her friend and elderly women, the one the Archduchess throning Egypt was also there. "Good morning Mrs Stroh, Margot asked me to bring you something and if you..." Mrs Stroh introduced me to her friend - Mrs Lavecky - Mr Krauss.
