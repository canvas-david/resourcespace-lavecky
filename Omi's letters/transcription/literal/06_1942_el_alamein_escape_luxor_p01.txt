1942, the Germans advanced 2 hrs from Alexandria, in El Alamein. What will happen to us Refugees? Barbara - at that time she was married Haberfeld, had a little Ford. You probably never saw a car like that, when you opened the boot there were 2 seats one could squeeze in. No cover of course. There was a sort of promise from the English, that if we went to Upper Egypt, they would help us to escape to South Africa. Well we packed the most necessary things and set on the route. We drove 2 days in the desert up to Luxor, the temperature went up to 50° + sandstorms whistled around us. All we had Vily + I hend in the back of the car was a sheet to protect us against the sun. When we arrived in Luxor Vily was running a temperature of over 42°. We found a doctor who could speak English. He was a christian Copte and to who owned a small living there. Still I am sure I owe him Vily's survival. He gave him Ether to drink + we kept him cool with ice water day + night. Barbara + I took turns. After a few days the fever fell. The Germans were still in El Alamein, the situation looked rather grim - but it also looked as if the Germans were digging in it looked as if at least the British had stopped their advance. Vily got better and decided to go back to Cairo so did Barbara's husband. We two girls stayed on. In that time (only a week) we roamed around Luxor. It was an unreal time. Frightened that the Germans will overrun Egypt we still got our energy + courage together to visit the Temples and Excavations
