PART I: INTRODUCTIONS - WHY OMI IS WRITING
#############################################################################

--- "Dear Danny" ---
[Source: 01_intro_dear_danny_vienna_childhood.pdf]

Dear Danny

After I have tried several times to "write" my memories in an unorthodox 
way - funny - jesting - good. I give up. I will just write facts in 
chronological order and then if I will still have time I might write a 
few episodes of my life.


--- To Danny ---
[Source: 02_intro_how_to_begin.pdf]

Danny, I told you often little episodes of my life but then you asked me 
to write a whole life story, a space over two generations, but I am not 
a writer - how do I begin?

Beginning... Start... All you will say that the beginning is easy - but 
where is the beginning? When I was born? When my parents married? When 
they got divorced when I was only three years?

You know what: I shall write just little episodes as they come to my 
mind and later you can put them into chronological order or just into a 
drawer and take them out when you are old like me and start to live with 
your memories.

Then one collects "memories" for later and over the years all memories 
are getting somehow mellower, the bad ones are getting better and the 
very exciting ones are also losing a bit of the excitement.

But believe me, in spite of many terrible experiences...


--- On Living a Full Life ---
[Source: 03_vienna_dobling_leaving_hitler.pdf]

My life - I consider myself very happy to have lived a very full and 
active life. Everybody in this world is allowed to start 3 times over 
and be successful. But then, our generation did not have it easy, but 
hard - that steel has to go through hot fire. Don't take it always the 
easy way, look out for challenges.

PART II: VIENNA - CHILDHOOD & YOUTH (Pre-WWI to 1938)
#############################################################################

--- Born Before WWI ---
[Source: 01_intro_dear_danny_vienna_childhood.pdf]

As you know I was born in Vienna before the first world war. When I was 
one year old the war ended. That war was called the WAR to end all wars. 
Little did they know that human nature was foxy.


--- The Factory Near Vienna ---
[Source: 01_intro_dear_danny_vienna_childhood.pdf]

After the war my Father... my parents then decided to start a factory 
near Vienna (Enzerdorf - and yes I should and would have taken you there 
when we were there, but helas - I broke my arm).

The factory was grinding colours from stones like ochre (yellow), red 
earth. My memory from that time relies on stories told to me later, but 
one thing sticks out of that time: we had white rabbits there and 
depending what colour was milled they were either pink, yellow or grey. 
And Mother told us I was very fair and my hair took all the coloured dust.

We also had a big shepherd dog called Rolfi - why? God knows. Rolfi was 
a female. We were together all the time. The house had a huge door to 
let horse-drawn wagons into the factory and cut into that big door was 
a smaller one. Now one day Rolfi who by now learned to open that little 
door, and one day I decided to go with Rolfi for a walk...


--- Vienna After WWI: The Cultural Life ---
[Source: 04_vienna_cultural_life_composers.pdf]

A little bit of background from your father, my Grandfather Vily, and 
the family.

Vienna, where I grew up, was poor after the first world war. But as 
many poor people, it tried to compensate with a lifestyle far beyond 
its means.

Theaters were full. Operas... there was Richard Tauber, Selma Kurz - 
great singers. Greater composers: Franz Lehár, Robert Stolz, Kálmán...


--- Döbling: School Years & First Love ---
[Source: 03_vienna_dobling_leaving_hitler.pdf]

Now back to the beginning. My real life started in 17 Leidesdorfgasse, 
Wien 19th Bezirk Döbling. That's where I spent my school years, my 
first love, my hopes, my big sorrows, the end of our family life, and 
where one part of my life ended - the place I left when Hitler came.

I left my family with one suitcase and a very sorry heart. All I loved...

You see, in spite of coming from what they call today a "broken home," 
I had the most wonderful youth one can imagine.

PART III: CAIRO & WWII - ESCAPE & SURVIVAL (1940s)
#############################################################################

--- Life in Cairo: Vily's Illness ---
[Source: 05_cairo_vily_illness_heat.pdf]

It was a most memorable time.

Back to Cairo, Vily was in a very bad state of health. We had one room 
in a "pension." Luckily the proprietress did not send Vily to hospital 
as suggested by a local doctor who thought that he had typhoid.

We kept him in bed. The one room we had - what a room! Facing west/
south-west, it was hot, really hot. We had days and weeks with 
temperature not dropping below 40°C.

Few entertainments were available... but in Cairo... the lady who gets 
herself dressed for dinner in the most beautiful colours of sunset, 
from gold to purple. The night - black with the biggest and brightest 
stars one can see, in the midst of it...


--- 1942: The Germans at El Alamein ---
[Source: 06_1942_el_alamein_escape_luxor.pdf]

1942, the Germans advanced to 2 hours from Alexandria, at El Alamein. 
What will happen to us refugees?

Barbara - at that time she was married to Paberfeld - had a little Ford. 
You probably never saw a car like that: when you opened the boot there 
were 2 seats one could squeeze into. No cover of course.

There was a sort of promise from the English that if we went to Upper 
Egypt, they would help us escape to South Africa.

Well, we packed the most necessary things and set on the route. We drove 
2 days in the desert up to Luxor. The temperature went up to 50°C+. 
Sandstorms whistled around us. All we had - Vily and I - was a sheet 
in hand in the back of the car to protect us against the sun.

When we arrived in Luxor, Vily had a temperature of over 42°C. We found 
a doctor who could speak English. He was a Christian Coptic, round and 
fat, who owned a small place there. Still I am sure I owe him Vily's 
survival. He gave him ether, kept him cool with ice water, day and night. 
Barbara and I took turns.

After a few days the fever fell. The Germans were still at El Alamein. 
The situation looked rather grim, but it also looked as if the Germans 
were stopping. It looked as if at least the British had stopped their 
advance.

Vily got better and we decided to go back to Cairo. So did Barbara and 
her husband. We hired two girls, stripped down. In that time (only a 
week) we wandered around Luxor.

It was an unreal time. Frightened that the Germans will overrun Egypt, 
we still got our energy and courage together to visit the temples and 
excavations.


--- The Path to Australia ---
[Source: 07_path_to_australia_mrs_lavecky.pdf]

How we came to Australia - I will write before how it developed in Cairo.

Well, after we came back from America, still undecided what and where 
to go, we were reluctant to leave all we had built up.

We considered seriously the offer of a friend only to settle in "Grecia" 
- a community near Florence. We were there. It is a lovely sleepy village 
surrounded by olive fields. The people there live mostly off farm products, 
and the women produced beautiful hand-embroidered lingerie.

Emilio had a little cottage there and wanted us to live in it, start a 
factory for underwear and have it supplemented with hand embroidery. 
Well, that was our plan.

Then things started to change in the most unusual way.

I had a friend - the Foldenbergs - our nanny at that time was her 
children's nurse. She gave me the message: could I run across the street 
where her mother-in-law lived, to give her an urgent message, as her 
telephone was out of order. And the lady who stayed with her was about 
to leave Egypt that same day.

So I went to Mrs. Stroh to give her the message. Her friend, a pleasant 
young woman, one of the refugees from Egypt, was also there.

Mrs. Stroh, Margot, asked me about my plans. This Stroh introduced me 
to her friend...

"Mrs. Lavecky - Mrs. Kramai."

[Source: 08_1977_karen_birth_family.pdf]

Around 1977 - Downy developed severe asthma and was in and out of 
hospital.

Karen was born 28th April 1977 - a very beautiful little tot.

After 4 months had to stop from one day to the other... trouble from 
one day to another with bread and afterwards with nerves.


--- Grandchildren's Bon Mots ---
[Source: 09_grandchildren_blue_mountains_diary.pdf]

Call to the track - young one asked: "Oma, is the fire gone in the 
Blue Mountains? Is Diamond there? And where? I miss you."

Other bon mot: "Oma, whom are you whispering to?"
"Harry and Nanny"
"What is his name?"
"Not a bad name..."

--- Reflections on Family & Health ---
[Source: 10_blue_mountains_health_reflections.pdf]

I feel lousy. After all, I care for that family hundreds of dollars, 
but for me it is nothing. Let it go.

My sugar is very high. There is enough of my money... we're not going 
to live too long. Make the best out of it.
