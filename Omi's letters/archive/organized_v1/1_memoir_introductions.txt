Dear Danny

After I have tried several times to "write" my memories in an unorthodox 
way - funny - jesting - good. I give up. I will just write facts in 
chronological order and then if I will still have time I might write a 
few episodes of my life.

As you know I was born in Vienna before the first world war. When I was 
one year old the war ended. That war was called the WAR to end all wars. 
Little did they know that human nature was foxy.

After the war my Father... my parents then decided to start a factory 
near Vienna (Enzerdorf - and yes I should and would have taken you there 
when we were there, but helas - I broke my arm).

The factory was grinding colours from stones like ochre (yellow), red 
earth. My memory from that time relies on stories told to me later, but 
one thing sticks out of that time: we had white rabbits there and 
depending what colour was milled they were either pink, yellow or grey. 
And Mother told us I was very fair and my hair took all the coloured dust.

We also had a big shepherd dog called Rolfi - why? God knows. Rolfi was 
a female. We were together all the time. The house had a huge door to 
let horse-drawn wagons into the factory and cut into that big door was 
a smaller one. Now one day Rolfi who by now leaned to open that little 
door, and one day I decided to go with Rolfi for a walk...

Danny, I told you often little episodes of my life but then you asked me 
to write a whole life story, a space over two generations, but I am not 
a writer - how do I begin?

Beginning... Start... All you will say that the beginning is easy - but 
where is the beginning? When I was born? When my parents married? When 
they got divorced when I was only three years?

You know what: I shall write just little episodes as they come to my 
mind and later you can put them into chronological order or just into a 
drawer and take them out when you are old like me and start to live with 
your memories.

Then one collects "memories" for later and over the years all memories 
are getting somehow mellower, the bad ones are getting better and the 
very exciting ones are also losing a bit of the excitement.

But believe me, in spite of many terrible experiences...

My life - I consider myself very happy to have lived a very full and 
active life. Everybody in this world is allowed to start 3 times over 
and be successful. But then, our generation did not have it easy, but 
hard - that steel has to go through hot fire. Don't take it always the 
easy way, look out for challenges.

Well, here I do not want to give advice...

Now back to the beginning. My real life started in 17 Leidesdorfgasse, 
Wien 19th Bezirk Döbling. That's where I spent my school years, my 
first love, my hopes, my big sorrows, the end of our family life, and 
where one part of my life ended - the place I left when Hitler came.

I left my family with one suitcase and a very sorry heart. All I loved...

You see, in spite of coming from what they call today a "broken home," 
I had the most wonderful youth one can imagine.
