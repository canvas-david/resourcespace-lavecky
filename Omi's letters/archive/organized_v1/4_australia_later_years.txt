--- 1977: Karen's Birth & Family Matters ---
[Source: 08_1977_karen_birth_family.pdf]

Around 1977 - Downy developed severe asthma and was in and out of 
hospital.

Karen was born 28th April 1977 - a very beautiful little tot.

After 4 months had to stop from one day to the other... trouble from 
one day to another with bread and afterwards with nerves.

[Family troubles with Michael - financial matters, bail money, TV 
purchases, disputes over payments and beds. George paid $400 for 
replacement. Michael was working at Larco most of the time sitting 
and smoking, then George caught him stealing...]

Call to the track - young one asked: "Oma, is the fire gone in the 
Blue Mountains? Is Diamond there? And where? I miss you."

Other bon mot: "Oma, whom are you whispering to?"
"Harry and Nanny"
"What is his name?"
"Not a bad name..."

Vickers... had to get up daily... Wayne's car... I was at Vickers. 
Vickers threw him out and told us he had a warning at home.

A visit here to Israel - Schul came for... and in the meantime Michael 
came back. Where did he get the money from? I wonder - souvenirs...

January - got a call from George to Blue Mountains. Stevens and Toch 
were there. He feels very sick and is going to hospital. I was very 
worried. 3 hours late, rang back. That he felt a little better. 
Right for a promised visit. Spin 2 days back when the 4th and all...

He said on the phone not to ring reverse charge as it costs twice as 
much - 50% more. He does not even know how much.

I feel lousy. After all, I care for that family hundreds of dollars, 
but for me it is nothing. Let it go.

My sugar is very high. There is enough of my money... we're not going 
to live too long. Make the best out of it.
