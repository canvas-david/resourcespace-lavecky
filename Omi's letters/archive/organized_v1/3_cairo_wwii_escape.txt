--- Cairo: Vily's Illness ---
[Source: 05_cairo_vily_illness_heat.pdf]

It was a most memorable time.

Back to Cairo, Vily was in a very bad state of health. We had one room 
in a "pension." Luckily the proprietress did not send Vily to hospital 
as suggested by a local doctor who thought that he had typhoid.

We kept him in bed. The one room we had - what a room! Facing west/
south-west, it was hot, really hot. We had days and weeks with 
temperature not dropping below 40°C.

Few entertainments were available... but in Cairo... the lady who gets 
herself dressed for dinner in the most beautiful colours of sunset, 
from gold to purple. The night - black with the biggest and brightest 
stars one can see, in the midst of it...


--- 1942: German Advance at El Alamein ---
[Source: 06_1942_el_alamein_escape_luxor.pdf]

1942, the Germans advanced to 2 hours from Alexandria, at El Alamein. 
What will happen to us refugees?

Barbara - at that time she was married to Paberfeld - had a little Ford. 
You probably never saw a car like that: when you opened the boot there 
were 2 seats one could squeeze into. No cover of course.

There was a sort of promise from the English that if we went to Upper 
Egypt, they would help us escape to South Africa.

Well, we packed the most necessary things and set on the route. We drove 
2 days in the desert up to Luxor. The temperature went up to 50°C+. 
Sandstorms whistled around us. All we had - Vily and I - was a sheet 
in hand in the back of the car to protect us against the sun.

When we arrived in Luxor, Vily had a temperature of over 42°C. We found 
a doctor who could speak English. He was a Christian Coptic, round and 
fat, who owned a small place there. Still I am sure I owe him Vily's 
survival. He gave him ether, kept him cool with ice water, day and night. 
Barbara and I took turns.

After a few days the fever fell. The Germans were still at El Alamein. 
The situation looked rather grim, but it also looked as if the Germans 
were stopping. It looked as if at least the British had stopped their 
advance.

Vily got better and we decided to go back to Cairo. So did Barbara and 
her husband. We hired two girls, stripped down. In that time (only a 
week) we wandered around Luxor.

It was an unreal time. Frightened that the Germans will overrun Egypt, 
we still got our energy and courage together to visit the temples and 
excavations.


--- How We Came to Australia ---
[Source: 07_path_to_australia_mrs_lavecky.pdf]

How we came to Australia - I will write before how it developed in Cairo.

Well, after we came back from America, still undecided what and where 
to go, we were reluctant to leave all we had built up.

We considered seriously the offer of a friend only to settle in "Grecia" 
- a community near Florence. We were there. It is a lovely sleepy village 
surrounded by olive fields. The people there live mostly off farm products, 
and the women produced beautiful hand-embroidered lingerie.

Emilio had a little cottage there and wanted us to live in it, start a 
factory for underwear and have it supplemented with hand embroidery. 
Well, that was our plan.

Then things started to change in the most unusual way.

I had a friend - the Foldenbergs - our nanny at that time was her 
children's nurse, to Peter's chamber-maid's son. She gave me the message: 
the factory wanted to know if I could run across the street where her 
mother-in-law lived, to give her an urgent message, as her telephone 
was out of order. And the lady who stayed with her was about to leave 
Egypt that same day.

So I went to Mrs. Stroh to give her the message. Her friend, a pleasantly 
young woman, one of the refugees from Egypt, was also there.

Mrs. Stroh, Margot, asked me about my plans. This Stroh introduced me 
to her friend...

"Mrs. Lavecky - Mrs. Kramai."
